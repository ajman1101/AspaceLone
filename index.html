        <h1>Welcome to my <strong>first <em>one</em>-man</strong> game!</h1>

<p>This game is a idea I have in my head for a while now and I have finally decided to make it into a game. This will be a interesting process, as I will be doing everything when it comes to the game, sound, art, programming, website, and all the other things needed to make a game. </p>

<h2>This is a <strong>learning</strong> project!</h2>

<p>You have been warned! I cannot promise a timetable for development or a schedule to fix bugs. This is my first actual project in Lua, not just scripting for level design in some game. I hope to get a good understanding out of Lua from this game and learn a lot about the game development process.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>

<p>As of this moment(6/23/2012) I have not nailed down the game design. I am working through the elements of the design and the mechanics to make a "fun" platforming game. This section will be updated shortly with more info about the game actual design when I have it, but give me time.</p>

<h2>The Look</h2>

<p>The though is "that look you get when clsoe your eyes very tight and suddenly look in a bright room" or gray psychedelic. I plan to have the game be black and white. Really the game's look will drive home the point of isolation and loneliness. </p>
